Time of recruitment to different sizes
--------------------------------------

Based on von Bertalanffy growth parameters given to the function, the CV
around length at age and the year of birth, this determines the
proporption of a year classâ€™s individuals that are at or above a certain
specified length in each year. This is plotted as cumulative
distribution functions. It assumes normally distributed lengths for an
age based on the cv supplied.
